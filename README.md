# 8 Puzzle Solver

### Course: Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
### Language & IDE: Python (Spyder)  

---

## Project Overview
This project implements the **A\*** search algorithm to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem efficiently. The program uses heuristic methods to find the shortest path from an initial puzzle configuration to the goal state.

---

## Features
- A* search algorithm implementation
- Heuristic based on Manhattan Distance
- Step-by-step solution visualization (console-based)
- User input for initial and goal states

---

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Run the main script in Spyder or any Python IDE:
   ```bash
   python Puzzle game.py
````

3. Follow the prompts to enter the initial and goal states.
4. View the solution steps in the output console.
